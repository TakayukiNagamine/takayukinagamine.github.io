title: "About Me"
---

I was born and grown up mostly in the (relatively) central and eastern part of the main island in Japan. I was born in Aichi Prefecture, where Toyota, the car manufacturer, is headquartered. I briefly lived in Saitama, near Tokyo, for five years, before I moved back to Aichi where I lived for the rest of my time in Japan.

## Railway & Travelling

I picked up an interest in trains when I was a young kid. The interest in railway somehow survives in me and I enjoy travelling on rail!
