## **L2 Articulatory Phonetics**

My primary research focus is centred around articulatory phonetics in L2 speech production. I'm particularly interested in production of English liquids by L1 Japanese speakers. I use the ultrasound tongue imaging technique to investigate the movement of the tongue while L1 Japanese speakers produce articulatorily-complex English /l r/.

## **L2 pronunciation learning and teaching**

As a second language English learner myself, I'm also interested in understanding the ways L2 learners improve their pronunciation and listening skills. Specific interests include the use of technology in improving L2 fluency and teaching of L2 listening within the world Englishes paradigm.
