## **L2 Articulatory/Acoustic Phonetics**

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "40%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tongue.png")
```

My primary research focus is centred around phonetics of L2 speech production. I use acoustic and articulatory methods (ultrasound tongue imaging) to understand more about why L1 Japanese speakers struggle to produce English /l/ and /r/.

## **L2 pronunciation learning and teaching**

```

As a second language English learner myself, I'm also interested in understanding how L2 learners could improve their pronunciation and listening skills. Specific interests include the use of technology in improving L2 fluency (with [Atsushi Miura](https://researchmap.jp/atsushimiura): Waseda University, Japan) and teaching of L2 listening within the world Englishes paradigm (with [Prof. Yuri Nishio](https://www.meijo-u.ac.jp/sp/foreign/educator/nishio/): Meijo University, Japan).
